## Introduction

The Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning project designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and past interactions. This system leverages collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations.

## Data
The dataset used for this project includes user ratings for movies. It consists of the following files:

`ratings.csv`: Contains user ratings for movies.
`movies.csv`: Contains movie metadata such as title, genres, and release date.

## Model
The recommendation system employs collaborative filtering (both user-based and item-based) and content-based filtering methods. It uses matrix factorization techniques for collaborative filtering and cosine similarity for content-based filtering.

## Evaluation
The system is evaluated using metrics such as `Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)` for rating predictions. 

## Future Work
Advanced Modeling Techniques: Explore deep learning-based recommendation systems and reinforcement learning approaches.
Real-Time Recommendations: Incorporate streaming data for dynamic recommendations.
Enhanced User Profiles: Analyze additional data sources to build more detailed user profiles.
Cross-Platform Integration: Expand the system to work seamlessly across multiple platforms.
A/B Testing and Optimization: Conduct A/B testing to compare different strategies and optimize algorithms.
